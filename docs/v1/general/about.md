LinkAce is a bookmark manager like Shaarli and other similar tools.  
I built this tool to have something that fits my personal needs which other bookmark managers couldn't solve,
even if most features are almost the same. I used Shaarli for a while but I never really felt very comfortable
with it. Maybe it was the inability to add another layer of taxonomy to saved links or the used template system which
stopped me from customizing the app like I want.

## Highlights

* Bookmark links with automatic title and description generation.
* Automated, regular link checks to inform you when a saved link goes offline or is moved to another location.
* Automated backups of your links via the [Waybackmachine](https://archive.org/web/web.php). All saved links are sent
    to the Waybackmachine which then stores a copy of the site for you.
* Private or public links. You decide, which saved links are private or which are accessible to the public.

## Other LinkAce features

* Organize bookmarks in lists and tags
* A bookmarklet to quickly save links from any browser
* Add notes to links to add thoughts
* Advanced search for your bookmarks
* Import existing bookmarks from HTML exports (other methods planned)
* Implemented support for complete database and app backups to Amazon AWS S3


## A note on support and new features

As mentioned, I built LinkAce for myself. Therefore I will only provide limited support for the application as well
as limit my work on it after all needed features are present. However, feature requests are always welcome and I will 
happily accept contributions.

**I do not provide any paid customization or support like installation help!**
