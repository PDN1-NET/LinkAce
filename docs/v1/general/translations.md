At the moment, LinkAce is only available in English. With a growing community more international users may
prefer to use the application in their own language.

## Help translating LinkAce

If you want to help translate LinkAce, please **join our project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/linkace)**.
LinkAce uses this service instead of regular version-controlled files to properly keep track of translated strings,
using moderation and verified strings.  
Currently, the top 30 most popular languages are targeted. If you want to translate a less popular one, please
open an issue in the repository.

Before a new language will be officially added to the application, it needs to be completely translated into the target
language. Also, those languages need regular users who are capable of translating or correcting strings for new
versions.
